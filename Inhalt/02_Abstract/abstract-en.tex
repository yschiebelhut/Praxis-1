The amount of robotic help in warehouses keeps increasing or work is even fully delegated to robots.
But these robots must be developed, and the systems must be presented to customers prior to purchase and integration into their personal environment.
Therefore, the possibility to simulate an entire environment in a performant way is very valuable.

This thesis deals with the creation of a service which simulates the \acs{OData} interface of an SAP \acl{EWM} system in a detailed way.
Such a service already exists although the current version suffers from great performance overhead due to is complex architecture.
Therefore, the concept of the service should be rethought from scratch.
Later on the service shall, among others, serve simulated robots in a Unity environment with sample orders.
